<font face="Verdana" size="1">George Orwell was born Eric Arthur Blair in 1903 in Motihari, Bengal, India. His father, Richard Walmesley Blair was a civil servant for the British government. In 1904 Orwell moved with his mother and sister to England where he remained until 1922\. He began to write at an early age, and was even published in college periodicals, but he did not enjoy school. Orwell failed to win a university scholarship and without the opportunity to continue his education he went to Burma and served in the administration of the Indian Imperial Police from 1922 to 1927 when he resigned in part due to his growing dislike of British imperialism. When Orwell returned to Europe he was in poor financial condition and worked low paying jobs in France and England. Finally, in 1928, he decided to become a professional writer. In 1933 he assumed the name _George Orwell_ by which he would become famous. It was **Animal Farm **that made finally Orwell prosperous. His other world wide success was **Nineteen Eighty-Four**, which Orwell said was written &quot;to alter other people's idea of the kind of society they should strive after.&quot; Sadly Orwell never lived to see how successful it would become. He died in London on January 21, 1950.</font>
