<div><font size="2"><font face="Trebuchet MS">**Based on your drawing and the 10 answers you gave this is a summary of your personality:
**Your house tells the world that you ought to be a leader. You are good at making friends and when the joyful moment arrives, you make the most out of it. You love your house and family. You are a gifted artist as well. Once you have a problem, you need a friend with you. Your life is always full of changes. You are very tidy person. There's nothing wrong with that because you're pretty popular among friends. Your life is always full of changes. 

When it comes to love, you shut yourself off. It's difficult to win your heart because you have decided to keep your feelings deep inside. You see the world as it is, not as you believe it should be. 

You are not a romantic person by nature. We also see that you are sensuous, sexual, and privately passionate. You are self-confident and happy with your life.</font></font></div>
