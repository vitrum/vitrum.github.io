<div id="msgcns!9697D6160EFEBC17!397" class="bvMsg"><div>Last week I went to the theatre. I had a very good seat. The play was very interesting. I did not enjoy it. A young man and a young woman were sitting behind me.They were talking loudly. I got very angry. I could not hear the actors. I turned round. I looked at the man and the woman angrily. They did not pay any attention. In the end, I could not bear it. I turned roung again. 'I can't hear a work!' I said angrily.</div>

<div>'It's none of your business,'the young man said rudely.'This is a private conversation!'</div></div>
