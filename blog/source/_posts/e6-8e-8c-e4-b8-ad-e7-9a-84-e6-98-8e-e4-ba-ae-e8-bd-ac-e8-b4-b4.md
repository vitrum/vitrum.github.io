As small as it is, this thing is bright. Each capsule docks onto a pad embedded with solar cells. You activate the light by twisting the capsule. It’s just a concept for now so technical specifications aren’t available but the idea is sound. In fact, I think cities should be giving citizens basic emergency supply kits - each one should include something like the Capsuli. <p>Designer: Ukseop Jeong &amp; Hanna Son <p>![Ukseop Jeong](http://yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2007/10/03/capsuli.jpg) <p>![](http://yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2007/10/03/capsuli2.jpg) <p>![](http://yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2007/10/03/capsuli3.jpg)
