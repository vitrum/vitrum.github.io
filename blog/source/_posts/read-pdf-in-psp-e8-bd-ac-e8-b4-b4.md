[Bookr 0.7.1 released](http://pgrevolution.com/2006/08/19/bookr-071-released/)
Published by [ZephyrWest](http://pgrevolution.com/author/zephyrwest/) 1 year, 4 months ago in [PSP](http://pgrevolution.com/category/psp/), [Homebrew](http://pgrevolution.com/category/psp/homebrew/). Tags: [Bookr](http://pgrevolution.com/index.php?tag=bookr).  

![Bookr](http://pgrevolution.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/08/bookr.jpg) <p>An update to one of the best homebrew applications (at least I think so) has been released. Bookr 0.7.1 doesn’t introduce any new features but does fix several bugs. Previously, Bookr had problems loading graphic heavy PDFs but this new release should alleviate some of those problems. Support for CJK fonts in PDF documents has been added as well. <p>Download Bookr 0.7.1 for [1.00](http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/bookr/bookr-0.7.1-fw10.zip?download) and [1.50](http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/bookr/bookr-0.7.1-fw15.zip?download)
[Download CJK fonts](http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/bookr/cjk-fonts-1.zip?download) 

*   Added support for PDF files with Chinese, Japanese and Korean text.  <li>Added a memory usage counter.  <li>Added single line scroll for the analog pad in the text viewer.  <li>Bookr will now try to block images from loading in PDF files when it is running low on memory.  <li>Fixed many memory leaks in the image loader for PDF files. Bookr can load and display PDF files with more images than before.  <li>Fixed memory leaks releasing the PDF viewer singleton.  <li>Restored full page scroll with cursor buttons.  <li>Fixed font corruption for large font sizes in the text viewer.  <li>Fixed page positions in the text viewer after changing the font size and/or font rotation. Bookmarks for text files are not compatible with older releases.
