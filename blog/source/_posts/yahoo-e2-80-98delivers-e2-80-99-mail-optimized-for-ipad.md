Here at Yahoo! we’re focused on reaching consumers wherever they are – across PC, mobile, TV and increasingly across tablet devices like iPad.

On the heels of our recently launched HTML5 mobile web mail for iPhone you’ll feel right at home with this experience. We’re keeping all the things users love about our new mobile Web mail, while optimizing it for the gorgeous large screen of the iPad. The iPad experience is:
Faster and more reliable: If you’re offline, Yahoo! Mail uses local caching capabilities to help you access and search your messages even without an internet connection.
Smart: You can find and organize your messages using Full Search, personal folders and Smart Folders with messages from your most important contacts and optimized views for photos and file attachments.

Feature Rich: View rich photo attachments in their full form, or as previews directly in the inbox view. Also includes a dual-pane view to make reading and organizing a breeze.
The new Yahoo! Mail experience is available globally to anyone who has an iPad. To check out Yahoo! Mail on your iPad, simply open up Safari and head on over to http://mail.yahoo.com.

Of course this is just the first version, and we be constantly iterating to add new features, improve performance, and make Yahoo! Mail for iPad the best it can possibly be. And please let us know what you think.
