**Web design-related forums** are a place where you interact with other designers, exchange ideas or discuss your first drafts. When you have a problem, you can post the issue, and then receive feedback on possible design or coding solutions from community members. This interaction is a great way to establish contacts and build relationships. Forums are used for networking and marketing purposes. They are practical places to solve problems and can serve as a form of social diversion.

### What is a good forum?

<p>As designers and developers, we choose a forum depending on its ability to **approach our needs**. In best case the forum should be large enough, moderators should be cooperative and the posts should be responded quickly. There is nothing worse than posting a thread on a forum and no one replies to it.
<p>In forums, users develop a reputation over time. The forum software can be used to track this. Some forums allow users to rate each other as well. Also, the more you participate and the more professional input you bring to the community, the more other members will recognize you and respect your opinion.
<p>The **quality of the community** is reflected by the level and depth of responses from community members. How well the forum is run has a direct impact on our ability to use it. The forum needs good moderation and clear guidelines. Even the design of the forum plays a role in our decision to use it. After all, every forum has its own personality.
<p>The **diversity of content** on forums is immense. Often, advice takes the form of Q&amp;A-discussions, but it can also take the form of articles, and tutorials as well. Threaded discussions are a huge part of forums, but some forums have areas that operate differently — marketplaces are an example, or design showcases.

<p>Content Management Systems often have great forums for web designers. E.g. if you’re a Wordpress user, you may frequent the [<u><font color="#0000ff">Wordpress Forums</font></u>](http://wordpress.org/support/). There you can pose installation questions, share your recent themes, extensions, modifications and plugins and ask for a help in building a WordPress-template.
<p>The type of career path you’ve chosen may lead you to forums as well. If you’re a freelancer then you may frequent forums such as the [<u><font color="#0000ff">Freelance Switch Forum</font></u>](http://forums.freelanceswitch.com/).
<p>While such types of forums are of use to a web designer, there are forums specifically designed for working web design professionals. We’ve compiled a list below. We’d like to hear your experiences with these or other web design forums.
