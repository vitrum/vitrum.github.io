<p>This is a typical scene at [<u><font color="#06085c">Book Expo America</font></u>](http://charkinblog.macmillan.com/ct.ashx?id=c15fd211-7020-42e5-bc0e-f0e4d2fd6ed3&amp;url=http://www.bookexpoamerica.com/App/homepage.cfm%3fmoduleid%3d42%26appname%3d288). A lot of people milling around aimlessly. But check out the picture below.

<p>There's no computer where a computer should be to the left of the gentleman's arm. You will also notice that there is no sign saying 'please do not steal the computers'. I confess that a colleague and I simply picked up two computers from the Google stand and waited in close proximity until someone noticed. This took more than an hour.
<p>Our justification for this appalling piece of criminal behaviour? The owner of the computer had not specifically told us not to steal it. If s/he had, we would not have done so. When s/he asked for its return, we did so. It is exactly what [<u><font color="#06085c">Google</font></u>](http://charkinblog.macmillan.com/ct.ashx?id=c15fd211-7020-42e5-bc0e-f0e4d2fd6ed3&amp;url=http://www.google.com/intl/en/about.html) expects publishers to expect and accept in respect to intellectual property. 
<p>'If you don't tell us we may not digitise something, we shall do so. But we do no evil. So if you tell us to desist we shall.'
<p>I felt rather shabby playing this trick on Google. They should feel the same playing the same trick on authors and publishers.
<p>On a more positive note (but not making me feel less shabby nor Google less guilty) Google threw a great party in their amazing New York offices, for which I am very grateful.

<div>Welcome </div>
<div>![](http://charkinblog.macmillan.com/themes/mono/rc.gif)This is it. I am officially entering the blogosphere. This is not a Macmillan blog, but Macmillan will certainly feature heavily. The idea is that when we need to share anything from company strategy through news, to talk about new ideas or to help us learn from our successes and our mistakes, we can all blog about it here. This means no more email newsletters from me. Instead, you can read (and blog) all about it here. And don't forget to bookmark this page and to let colleagues know all about it. 

The broader the audience the more effective this blog becomes. 

And it becomes a lot more interesting if you join the conversation... so don't be shy. </div></div></div>
