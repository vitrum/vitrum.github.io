<div id="msgcns!9697D6160EFEBC17!399" class="bvMsg"><div>It was Sunday. I never get up early on Sundays. I sometimes stay in bed until lunchtime. Last Sunday I got up very late.I looked out of the windows. It was dark outside. 'What a day!' I thought. 'It 's raining again.' Just then, the telephone rang. It was my aunt Lucy. 'I've just arriced by train,'she said.'I'm coming to see you.'</div>
<div> </div>
<div>'But I'm still having breakfast,'I said.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>'What art you doing?'she asked.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>'I'm having breakfast,'I repeated.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>'Dear me,'she said.'Do you always get up so late? It's one o'clock!'</div></div>
